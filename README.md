# InstantMocha
Mocha-Chai-Sinon with Gulp

Instant Mocha in CommonJS.

```
npm install
npm start
```

InstantMocha assumes your JS application can be found in ```server/app```.

You can correct that assumption by modifying ```gulp.conf.js``` with the paths used in your application.

Sample modules and sample module specs are included for JS applications.
